#### Summary

At the moment I haven not commercial experience as Front-End developer, but i do a lot of practice and learn new technologies and features. I like development because of many reasons. At first it very interesting for me and it`s a kind of magic when you force a machine to do something you want. At second in programming, this is amazing to see an immediate result of your work. And the third only in Front-End I found such a friendly community, guys who always happy to help you in any question even stupid question. I think it is the most dynamic and creative community in the development branch and I would be glad to become a part of it.
